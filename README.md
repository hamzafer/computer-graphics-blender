## Overview
This project leverages Blender's Cycles rendering engine, various addons, and custom modeling to recreate realistic scenes of aquatic mammals in their natural environments. The work primarily involves modeling water surfaces, creating landscapes, and crafting detailed animal models.

## Features
- Island Scene with Surrounding Sea
- Seal on a Beach with Rocks
- Shark in Open Waters
- Multiple Sharks with Mountains
- Dolphin and Whale modeling with realistic textures

## Algorithms & Techniques
- **Blender’s Cycles Engine:** Utilized for advanced ray tracing and realistic rendering.
- **Node Wrangler Add-On:** Streamlined texture node setup for improved efficiency.
- **ANT Landscape Add-On:** Used to generate realistic terrains and mountains.
- **Custom Modeling Techniques:** Incorporating subdivision, mirroring, and mesh manipulation for accurate animal modeling.
- **Textures & Shading:** Extensive use of custom textures and shaders for water, sand, rocks, and animal models.

## Work Distribution

### Contributions by Thomas
- Created the Island Scene with Surrounding Sea.
- Modeled the Blue Whale with anatomical precision.
- Developed rock models for the Island Scene.
- Structured and wrote the project report.

### Contributions by Hamza
- Developed the Seal and Beach Scene with realistic textures.
- Created shark models and an underwater scene.
- Generated multiple sharks with mountain backgrounds.
- Experimented with unique rendering techniques for realistic water effects.

## Challenges
- Achieving realistic water textures and reflections.
- Maintaining anatomical accuracy in animal models.
- Enhancing realism through texture and lighting adjustments.

## Results
Rendered using Blender’s Cycles engine with a NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 GPU, producing high-quality 4K renders. The scenes capture realistic depictions of aquatic mammals with natural environments.
